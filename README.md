    <h1>Period to Exclamation point</h1>
    <h3>Chrome v3 extension to replace periods with exclamation points</h3>
</div>

Tired of feeling like you need to chill on the exclamation points and frustrated that no one else seems to be using them enough? 
Keen to add an aura of hysteria to the emails or paper articles you read on the internet?   

Install this minimal extension that replaces single periods with three exclamation points. It's largely built off of this 🚀 [Minimal Chrome extension template using manifest v3](https://github.com/SimGus/chrome-extension-v3-starter) 🚀 and the [millennials-to-snake-people chrome extension](https://github.com/ericwbailey/millennials-to-snake-people). 

## Installation 🌸 
- **Fork** this repo, then **clone your forked repo locally**. If you don't have a github account, you can simply download a zip of the repo and unzip it on your computer.
- **Open [the extensions page](chrome://extensions)** in your browser: `chrome://extensions`. This link works on any chromium-based browser.
- If you did not do it already, **toggle the "developer mode"**. This is usually a toggle button at the top right of the extensions page.
- Click the button **_load unpacked extension_**.
- In the window that pops up, **select the folder that contains this minimal extension**, then **click _ok_**.
- **Done!** A new extension called _Periods to Exclamations!!!_ should have appeared in the list.
